                    Part of our mysterious galaxy encompasses satellites that roam through the earth gathering billions of data points. 
                    From the invention of the first computer, technology has drastically improved our collective ability to understand and identify complex relationships.  
                    Utilizing big data, artificial intelligence, fcc data api and various technology, we created predictive models to help to empower those in need by giving us insight into the specific populations and regions needing the most amount of resources and the best way to deploy the limited amount of resources the earth has. 
                    By focusing on critical trends in pollution, government policies, demographics / social and economic status,  weather and pre-existing conditions, we can find the most effective way of deploying their sources we have to effectively combat Coronavirus. Right now is the time, where we create a lasting impact to sustain our Earth.

                  <p class> Research done by scientists at Harvard T.H. Chan School of public health suggest that warmer weather does not halt transmission of the virus, contrary to popular belief. (Powell, 2020).
                    Research done by scientists in China also supports this hypothesis.
                    Utilizing meteorological factors of 122 cities, they concluded that there is no evidence of decline when the temperature increases. (Xie, 2020).
                    These results are particularly concerning, as many government officials rely on warmer weather to "mitigate" the disease's infectivity. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a result, one may hypothesize that that many may rely on this false assumption to guide their decision-making, resulting in "warmer areas" having more relaxed policies/behaviors and less social distancing. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Precipitation data was also included in our model, as seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation (e.g rainfall) as well as
                    rapid changing weather variability can exert strong pressures on infectious population dynamics. (Chiyomaru and Takemoto, 2020)

                    Global temperature and UV data was gathered from NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument web data portal.
                    Global precipitation data was gathered by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) GCOM-W1 (Global Change Observation Mission) Shizuku's AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer). The data was collected from JAXA's G-Portal.

                  <p class> 
                      As Coronavirus has spread, there has also been an observable decrease in pollution due to reduced human activity (e.g less commuters on the road and less people going to work).

                      However, as states and regions relax restrictions and social distancing, human activity increases, resulting in more pollution.

                      NO2, or Nitrogen Dioxide, is a common byproduct of industrial activity that is hazerdous to human health. As a result, it can provide a fairly accurate measure of industrial activity.

                      Areas with higher levels of pollution often also have a greater percentage of the population with preexisting conditions, increasing Coronavirus' severity/lethality.
                      As a result, NO2 is a good metric for estimating economic activity and measuring the susceptibility of populations in certain regions to Coronavirus.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      We sourced the NO2 data from OMINO2 (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and acquired it from the EarthDATA portal.

                    We also fed in historical numer of cases, deaths, incidence rate, new cases, and population per county into the model. This data is important because it provides a historic/near-present trajectory of the number of cases and deaths.


                    We gathered this information via Johns hopkins University's COVID-19 "USCounties_time" records.

                    <br>
                    Additional health information such as life expectancy, poor mental health days was also included in our model, gathered from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program, a large philanthropic foundation.
<!-- 
                    The mortality rate increases with people that have pre-existing conditions.
                    45.4% of people with complications of the coronavirus typically come from people who have previous conditions (Cardiovascular disease, Cancer, Diabetes). (Adams, 2020) · 
                    In particular, the 7 risk factors of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption together contributed to an average of 41.4% of the burden of 5 of the 6 chronic conditions used in our study. (Adams, 2020)
                    This makes a large population of people more susceptible to the fatalities of the coronavirus. In America, the level of Obesity is the highest in the world, making the people in the US more fatal to the coronavirus. 
                    “More than 2 in 3 adults were considered to be overweight or have obesity” “About 1 in 6 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 were considered to have obesity.”(Ogden, 2020)
                     With such high levels of people being obese in America, if everyone got infected by the corona virus, it would be extremely deadly and cause hospital to over flow again. 
                     These are places where the government needs to look at as hot spots so that the American population could be protected against this virus before it becomes deadly. Also as people get older, they begin to have more diseases associated with them including heart problems, cancer and much more, making it imperative for us to access them as hot spots.

                    Minorities, especially African-Americans, have an on-average higher death rate compared to other races.
                    “African American persons (92.3 deaths per 100,000 population) and Hispanic/Latino persons (74.3) that were substantially higher than that of white (45.2) or Asian (34.5) persons.”(IHME, 2020). 
                    This trend may be attributed to their living conditions and neighborhoods. As they tend to reside in more densely populated areas and are thus may be more susceptible to transmission, making it hard to social distance people from one another. 
                    In addition, most of the professions that the minority communities have does not include health insurance or paid time off making it very hard for them to seek treatment. (CDC).
                    As a result, social demographics play an important role in identifying hot spots.

                    In addition to race, we also sourced data for %rural, % severe housing problems, % ethnicities, etc. and fed it into our model. We sourced this information from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program.
                   
                    Poverty and unemployment data was also sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service.

                    To better understand population concentrations, we gathered night light satellite data from NASA's Suomi-NPP's (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument from the month of January 2020. However, we were not able to finish formatting and feeding this data into our model in time.

                    We also used mobility data from Google to supplement the information to better understand human movements and activities.

                    However, health officials are afraid that if we open the states up too quickly may undo everything everyone has done to flatten the curve. 
                    A good case study is Japan. Their initial rigorous restrictions kept their number of cases low. However, after lifting the restriction too quickly they were forced to shut down a second time due to a second wave of coronavirus cases. (Leonard, 2020).
                    The economy is in a very tough shape right now causing many governors to overlook some of the criteria for reopening. 31 out of the 50 states have already begun to partially reopen, causing a resurgence in the total amounts of deaths due to Coronavirus. 

                    We sourced Government action data from multistate.us, which provides a COVID-19 Policy data at the state level.
                     
                    Thus, government restrictions are an important input to the model.

                  <p class> The spread of the coronavirus is extremely contagious, and current methods of social distancing and stay at home order can only flatten the curve so much.
                     As states begin to reopen we want to examine places and activities where hot spots can form. 
                     Utilizing NASA and other open source data , we were able to determine the five largest categories to look at for hot spots. 
                     The data was read in using python. With the utilizing python functions we were able to merge the files into one large readable data file. That helped us create a good training model for machine learning.
                      We were also able to create a choropleth using leaflet javascript making an interactive map of places we consider as hot spots. This will allow us to understand what places to look at as hotspots as the regulations begin to loosen.

                    Part of our mysterious galaxy encompasses satellites that roam through the earth gathering billions of data points. 
                    From the invention of the first computer, technology has drastically improved our collective ability to understand and identify complex relationships.  
                    Utilizing big data, artificial intelligence, fcc data api and various technology, we created predictive models to help to empower those in need by giving us insight into the specific populations and regions needing the most amount of resources and the best way to deploy the limited amount of resources the earth has. 
                    By focusing on critical trends in pollution, government policies, demographics / social and economic status,  weather and pre-existing conditions, we can find the most effective way of deploying their sources we have to effectively combat Coronavirus. Right now is the time, where we create a lasting impact to sustain our Earth.

                  <p class> Many people assume that with higher temperature, the less effective the coronavirus will be similar to the common cold. 
                    The cold is more prevalent in the winter comprare to the summer. But that may not be the case for this virus. Research done by scientists at Harvard T.H. Chan School of public health have published online journal articles looking at the outlook of the coronavirus during different seasons. 
                    In every model that they predicted, the warm weather did not halt transmission of the virus. (Powell, 2020) This is something very dangerous, because it is a thought that many Americans and government officials have before. 
                    They may open up a state prematurely believing that because of the warm weather people do not need to be concerned about the virus spreading. 
                    Any place where social distancing cannot happen properly during the warm temperatures are places to be looking at for hot spot locations.In addition, research done by scientists in China has proved something similar with regards to the association of the coronavirus with ambient temperatures. 
                    Utilizing meteorological factors of 122 cities, they concluded that there is no evidence of decline when the temperature increases. (Xie, 2020). With that in mind crowded cities should be looked at more as a hotspot because the distance between each person is minimal and the spread of the diseases is still extremely common.

                  <p class> The level of pollution each country has produced is the most  dramatic change caused by the coronavirusLevels have dropped significantly after this pandemic began. 
                      This is caused by factories closing down and just in general a lower movement by people. 
                      Following social distancing rules and stay at home order, it  has created a better environment for people. 
                      Pollution levels are a very important factor that needs to be considered because when there are high levels of pollution, there is also a high exertion of NO2 gas and nitrate which is extremely dangerous to humans. 
                      Nitrate has the ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and then into the bloodstream causing people to get heart problems and other fatal diseases. (Hernandez, 2020 )This is a determinate especially during this pandemic. 
                      The corona virus is known to have a low mortality rate ranging between 5.9 % to 16.3% (Hopkins, 2020). But the level increases with other diseases considered. Levels can spike up to 41% which makes it a very important factor to consider. 
                      Below there are graphs attached that show dramatic changes with countries after the pandemic. As stores and factories begin to reopen, we need to monitor the amount of pollutant released or else the second wave of the coronavirus may be worse than the original having a higher fatality rate.

                  <p class> The mortality rate increases with people that have pre-existing conditions.
                    45.4% of people with complications of the coronavirus typically come from people who have previous conditions (Cardiovascular disease, Cancer, Diabetes). (Adams, 2020) · 
                    In particular, the 7 risk factors of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption together contributed to an average of 41.4% of the burden of 5 of the 6 chronic conditions used in our study. (Adams, 2020)
                    This makes a large population of people more susceptible to the fatalities of the coronavirus. In America, the level of Obesity is the highest in the world, making the people in the US more fatal to the coronavirus. 
                    “More than 2 in 3 adults were considered to be overweight or have obesity” “About 1 in 6 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 were considered to have obesity.”(Ogden, 2020)
                     With such high levels of people being obese in America, if everyone got infected by the corona virus, it would be extremely deadly and cause hospital to over flow again. 
                     These are places where the government needs to look at as hot spots so that the American population could be protected against this virus before it becomes deadly. Also as people get older, they begin to have more diseases associated with them including heart problems, cancer and much more, making it imperative for us to access them as hot spots.

                  <p class> Africian Americans and the hispanic population have a much higher death rate compared to the other races. 
                    “African American persons (92.3 deaths per 100,000 population) and Hispanic/Latino persons (74.3) that were substantially higher than that of white (45.2) or Asian (34.5) persons.”(IHME, 2020). 
                    The main reason why the African American and the hispanic populations have such high mortality rates compared to the other populations is due to the living conditions that they live in and the jobs that most of the minority population work in. 
                    Nearly a quarter of the service industry is employed by hispanic and black workers.Also due to the low paying jobs the minority population are forced to live close to each other causing a large issue especially when we are trying to maintain social distancing. 
                    In addition, most of the professions that the minority communities have does not include health insurance or paid time off making it very hard for them to seek treatment. (CDC). This makes the minority population a place to look at when we are seeking for hot spots.

                  <p class> In the news, we see residents of each state beginning to protest against the stay at home orders and states beginning to reopen. 
                    With Georgia being one of the first states to reopen, health officials are afraid that if we open the states up too quickly we can undo everything we have done to flatten the curve. 
                    A good example is with Japan. They had a great containment of the corona virus at first, but after lifting the restriction too quickly they were forced to shut the island down for a second time due to a rise in the second wave of coronavirus cases. (Leonard, 2020).
                     The economy is in a very tough shape right now causing many governors to overlook some of the criteria for reopening. 31 out of the 50 states have already begun partial reopening causing a spike in the model for the total amounts of deaths due to the coronavirus. 
                     The projected amount of deaths increased from 77,000 to 131,000 after states began to reopen. Shown in the university of Washington Health Metrics and Evaluation. (George Washington University,2020). Some partial reopening includes reopening places where social distancing is possible like Zoos and parks.
                      But as places like the gym, or the movie theater begins to reopen, it would be much harder to maintain social distancing. With the data that NASA and other agencies have provided, we can examine closely the states that have had a looser restriction in order to provide resources to the states that need it the most.
